        var a = 10;

        function add() {
            a += 10;
        }
        var startFunc = _.once(add);
        console.log(a); //10
        startFunc();
        console.log(a); //20
        startFunc();
        console.log(a);// 20
        startFunc();
        console.log(a); //20

        <pre>
            Then the first time the ‘startFunc()’ is called the value of ‘a’ is incremented by 10 and becomes 20.
            So the output of first time calling is 20. Then the next time when ‘startFunc()’ is called the value of ‘a’ is again supposed to be incremented by 10
            but this does not happen.
